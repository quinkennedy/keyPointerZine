#Key Point zine

A generative zine of random layouts displaying geometric forms arranged in relation to a shared key point.

Each copy selects a "key point" at random, and uses that as the focus point for the compositions throughout the zine. [demo.pdf](demo.pdf) is a sample.

Version 1 was created for [C.A.B.](http://comicartsbrooklyn.com/) 2015 and produced by [PaperBon.net](http://paperbon.net).
